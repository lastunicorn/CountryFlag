## Disclaimer

This is an open source project maintained in my free time.
I apologize in advance for any errors or inconsistencies.

## Information Source

The main source of information is Wikipedia. I took the countries' ISO codes, flag description and svg images which I translated later into xaml.

## Possible Errors

If you discover any errors in the flags, please create an issue in GitHub describing it. I will analyze it and try to fix it in a reasonable amount of time.
