CountryFlags 1.1.0
====================================================================================================

A WPF user control and a library containing the flags used by the world's countries.

This is an open source project maintained in my free time.
I apologize in advance for any errors or inconsistencies.

The country information and the flags are taken mainly from Wikipedia which is itself in a continuous
process of change and improvement.

If you discover any errors or missing flags, please create an issue in GitHub. I will analyze it and
try to fix it in a reasonable time.
